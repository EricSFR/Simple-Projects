<h3>This is a very simple NE555 based function generator</h3>
<p>This project is a simple function generator based on the NE555, which generates a base wave and with a series of filters, it can generate square,
triangle, sine, and sawtooth-ish waveforms. The design uses two operational amplifiers (OpAmps) to control the offset and amplitude of the wave.
The first OpAmp is configured as an inverting voltage subtractor, allowing the signal to be coupled to a controlled voltage level. The second OpAmp 
acts as an inverting amplifier, giving you control over the amplitude.</p>
<p>Overall, this function generator is an excellent educational tool. It demonstrates the versatility of the NE555 and basic signal processing techniques with OpAmps.</p>
